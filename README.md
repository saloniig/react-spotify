## What is the use of this Repo
We will be creating a Spotify Web player that displays information about your currently played music from Spotify. We will also demonstrate how to:

-   Register an application with Spotify
-   Authenticate a user and get authorization to access user data
-   Retrieve the data from a Web API endpoint

## Prerequisites

### Install Node JS

Refer to  [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)  to install nodejs

### Install create-react-app

Install create-react-app npm package globally. This will help to easily run the project and also build the source files easily. Use the following command to install create-react-app

`npm install -g create-react-app`

### Spotify API
- Go to the [Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) page at the Spotify Developer website, and click on ‘My New App'. 
- Fill out the information for your new app using the form as a guide.
- The most important thing is that you must put in a redirect URL. We are going to use the default URL of from the Create React App. Enter [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in this field. This is the URL you want to be redirected to after a user has authenticated through Spotify.
- Click “Save” and be sure to write down the Client ID from your application. And congrats, you’ve just registered your application and now we are ready to jump into the code.

## Cloning and Running the Application in local
